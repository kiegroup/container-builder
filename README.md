# Container Builder

This project is now incorporated by the [Kogito Serverless Operator](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/). See the `container-builder` package. You can still use it in your projects since it's still a separated go module:

```go
import github.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/container-builder/...
```
